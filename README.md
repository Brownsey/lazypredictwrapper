This repo will aim to cover three main areas
* Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis
* Automatic Data Preparation
* Automatic Modelling

For each of these areas the end idea will be to use a config file so that it will be possible to store exact runs for the future 
and have the required helper functions to automatically store this information on GCP or equivilant if required
